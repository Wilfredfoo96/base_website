Here is the executive summary of your Logistics Management System project.

Project Goal
To build a centralized digital ecosystem that streamlines the delivery process, managing the flow from order placement to final delivery. The system solves the "blind spot" between dispatch and arrival using a unique Dynamic Tracking Logic.

The Core Logic (The "Smart" Feature)
The system changes what the customer sees based on the driver's specific actions:

The Waiting Room (Queue): If the driver is busy with other deliveries, the customer sees "3 stops away."

The Approach (ETA): The moment the driver presses "Start Trip" for that specific customer, the view switches to "Arriving in 12 mins" with a live map.

The Three Pillars
1. Admin Portal (The Brain)
Function: Control center for Dispatchers/Admins.

Key Capabilities:

Payment Guard: Admins manually verify Bank Transfer receipts (uploaded by users) before orders are processed. Includes audit logs for security.

Route Command: Assign orders to "On-Duty" drivers. Includes manual drag-and-drop sorting or an "Auto-Optimize" button.

Cash Reconciliation: Tracks exactly how much Cash on Delivery (COD) money each driver is holding.

2. Driver App (The Legs)
Function: Utility tool for execution.

Key Capabilities:

Workflow: Drivers toggle "On-Duty" to appear available. They receive a sequential "Manifest" (task list).

Navigation: One-click integration with Google Maps/Waze.

Proof: Mandatory Photo Proof of Delivery required to close an order.

Exceptions: Specific buttons to handle "Failed Delivery" (nobody home) or "Returns" (rejected goods).

3. Customer App (The Wallet)
Function: Storefront and Tracker.

Key Capabilities:

Ordering: Browse products, manage cart, and choose payment (COD or Bank Transfer).

Verification: Users must upload a screenshot of their bank transfer receipt for approval.

Tracking: View the "Queue vs. ETA" status updates.

Lock-In: The "Cancel Order" button disappears the moment the driver starts the trip.
